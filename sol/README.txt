Q1: Choose one step of the hiring process that the article goes over
and discuss how bias manifests itself. Think about underlying reasons for this.

We found the section about shaping the candidate pool through advertisements
particularly interesting. We did not previously think about how similar
job-advertising algorithms are to regular product advertisement algorithms in
that they predict not who will be successful in the role, but rather, who is
most likely to click on that job ad. This makes sense when realizing that
companies have a limited budget and want to maximize the number of potential
candidates for their positions while minimizing their costs. Thus, especially if
the algorithm relies on existing employee data, it makes sense that it will
favor advertising to candidates who most closely fit a job’s stereotype, e.g.
female cashiers or black cab drivers. Though this might minimize companies’
costs, it certainly results in a skewed applicant pool and perpetuates existing
biases, ultimately reducing diversity and potentially causing companies to
miss out on great candidates who do not necessarily fit their job’s stereotype.

Q2. What do you notice in the differences between cis male and cis female hired
ratios printed out?


Cis Female ratio hired: 0.49, 0.49, 0.49,
Cis Male ratio hired: 0.49, 0.49, 0.49,
